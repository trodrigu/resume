\opening{Dear Recruiter:} 
 
% \noindent PARAGRAPH ONE: State reason for letter, name the position or type 
% of work you are applying for and identify source from  which  you 
% learned   of   the  opening.  (i.e.  Career  Development  Center, 
% newspaper, employment service, personal contact). 

\noindent I am writing this letter to get a chance to interview for the position of Manufacturing Engineer I.  I learned of the opening after seeing it on the TE careers page.
 
% \noindent PARAGRAPH  TWO:  Indicate why you are interested in the position, 
% the company, its products, services - above all, stress what  you 
% can  do  for  the employer. If you are a recent graduate, explain 
% how your academic background makes you a qualified candidate  for 
% the  position.  If  you have practical work experience, point out 
% specific achievements or unique qualifications. Try not to repeat 
% the  same  information  the reader will find in the resume. Refer 
% the reader to the enclosed resume or application which summarizes 
% your  qualifications,  training,  and experiences. The purpose of 
% this section is to strengthen your resume  by  providing  details 
% which bring your experiences to life. 

\noindent I am interested in the position of Manufacturing Engineer because I want to join the ranks of a Thomson Reuters Top 100 Global Innovator.  In this day and age where every one is dependent on a network, proper connectivity is paramount at ensuring business is done in the most efficient manner.  Coming from a Mechanical Engineering background, I am able to understand that life is full of irreversibility and it is up us to minimize it.  Knowledge of stress/strain, cycles to failure, the laws of thermodynamics, and basic cost/benefit analysis have helped me to understand the world.  I would ensure that wherever applicable this learning is applied in the Manufacturing Engineering role.
% \noindent PARAGRAPH THREE: Request a personal interview and  indicate  your 
% flexibility as to the time and place. Repeat your phone number in 
% the letter and offer assistance to help in a speedy response. For 
% example,  state that you will be in the city where the company is 
% located on a certain date and would like to set up an  interview. 
% Or,  state  that  you  will  call  on a certain date to set up an 
% interview. End the letter by thanking  the  employer  for  taking 
% time to consider your credentials. 

\noindent At the moment I am working full time, however, I am capable of scheduling an interview within a weeks notice because of the ability to work from home.  My phone number is (619)-248-0717.  Thank you for taking the time to consider my credentials.
 
\closing{Sincerely yours,}
