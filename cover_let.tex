\opening{Dear Mr. James:} 
 
% \noindent PARAGRAPH ONE: State reason for letter, name the position or type 
% of work you are applying for and identify source from  which  you 
% learned   of   the  opening.  (i.e.  Career  Development  Center, 
% newspaper, employment service, personal contact). 

\noindent I am writing this letter to get a chance to interview for the position of Junior Software Engineer.  I learned of the opening after perusing the Stack Careers page.
 
% \noindent PARAGRAPH  TWO:  Indicate why you are interested in the position, 
% the company, its products, services - above all, stress what  you 
% can  do  for  the employer. If you are a recent graduate, explain 
% how your academic background makes you a qualified candidate  for 
% the  position.  If  you have practical work experience, point out 
% specific achievements or unique qualifications. Try not to repeat 
% the  same  information  the reader will find in the resume. Refer 
% the reader to the enclosed resume or application which summarizes 
% your  qualifications,  training,  and experiences. The purpose of 
% this section is to strengthen your resume  by  providing  details 
% which bring your experiences to life. 

\noindent I am interested in the position because I identify with the concern for ultimate quality and see to it that our peers, loved ones and customers receive what they deserve.  I understand that my experience lies a little short at 1 years of software developing experience, but the assortment of projects I have completed as a Freelance Developer and as a lover of programming (Test Driven of course) have allowed me to understand the necessities of git, TDD with rSpec, a great starting point (Rails and Django), and of course the open source community.  I have deployed 6 different sites to the world wide web each demonstrating my understanding of a good user interface as well as a good user experience.  Currently I am a Web Content/Social Media Manager for a small business, Azmira Holistic Animal Care, and I have carried out my quest for ultimate quality by ensuring a better return of investment for the business' 3 websites and their Google Adwords campaigns.  I am confident that I will bring value to your company.
 
% \noindent PARAGRAPH THREE: Request a personal interview and  indicate  your 
% flexibility as to the time and place. Repeat your phone number in 
% the letter and offer assistance to help in a speedy response. For 
% example,  state that you will be in the city where the company is 
% located on a certain date and would like to set up an  interview. 
% Or,  state  that  you  will  call  on a certain date to set up an 
% interview. End the letter by thanking  the  employer  for  taking 
% time to consider your credentials. 

\noindent At the moment I am working full time, however, I am capable of scheduling an interview within a weeks notice because of the ability to work from home.  My phone number is (619)-248-0717 and I plan on being in San Diego on March 5th for the San Diego Ruby Meetup which means an interview between March 5th and 8th would be fantastic.  Thank you for taking the time to consider my credentials.
 
\closing{Sincerely yours,}
